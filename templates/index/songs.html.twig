    All The Things You Are
    As Time Goes By
    At Long Last Love
    But Not For Me
    Cheek To Cheek
    Everything Happens To Me
    Fly Me To The Moon
    From This Moment On
    Give Me the Simple Life
    How About You?
    How Deep Is The Ocean?
    How High The Moon?/Ornithology
    I Believe In You
    I Can't Give You Anything But Love
    I Concentrate On You
    I Didn't Know What Time It Was
    I Love You
    In The Still Of The Night
    It Could Happen To You
    I've Got The World On A String
    I've Got You Under My Skin
    I Won't Dance
    Just One Of Those Things
    Let's Face The Music And Dance
    Love Is Here To Stay
    Mean To Me
    Night And Day
    Ring-A-Ding-Ding
    Satin Doll
    Stars Fell On Alabama
    The Song Is You
    Will You Still Be Mine?
    You're Driving Me Crazy
